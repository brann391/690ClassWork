# Systems Librarianship

This is the Readme for the 690 class at UK. 
I will also be using this to add notes to as I go along the class.

## Setting up a Bare Bones OPAC

Today we installed Apache2, PHP, and MySQL onto our server. Everything went very smoothly and wrapped up nicely. 
I also copied and displayed the opac.php in my browser as required. 
This one was pretty long, no gonna lie. 
But it mostly took a while because I was trying to type in the code by hand, but instead I started copying over the code as I kept mistyping and it did not like that when I was adding records. 

## Adding more to the OPAC

Today we recreated the HTML and PHP files, as stated in our course.
We also added additional records to our new OPAC to make sure we knew had to add to our records.

## Create a Bare Bones Cataloging Module

We created an index.html in a new directory so it can be accessible from the web.
Created insert.php in that same directory.
Secured our directory with a password.
Added some more records using the web form.
Retrieve said records.

## Installing Wordpress

We installed Wordpress and messed around with it.

## Install Omeka

We installed Omeka, but with less hand holding to reinforce our last week's coding.

## Install Koha ILS

Installed Koha. Had to reinstall Koha as I had done something to anger the coding gods.
Now Koha is working as intended and I can access both the public and administration side.
